###Experience


* **Cyrus Innovation**
  (March 2007-January 2014)

  _Senior Agile Developer and Developer Coach_

  At Cyrus I have written software for clients using Extreme
  Programming practices and a range of technologies. I've coached new
  team members at all experience levels helping them get up to speed
  extremely quickly. I regularly facilitate retrospective meetings
  using a toolkit of analytic techniques to remove obstacles and solve
  problems.

  _Senior Developer and Coach with Cyrus_

  Developed a web app that provides an intuitive abstraction for
  managing raw cloud computing resources. Users can manage resources
  from AWS as well as from internal VMWare clusters. The app uses
  rails, mysql, sidekiq and fog.io with tests written in rspec and
  mocha.

* **Bazaarvoice**
  (Oct 2012-May 2013)
  _Senior Developer with Cyrus_

  Developed software for a business to business sales portal where
  brand representatives purchase and configure BV products. The app is
  a java based web app using spring mvc, gwt and dropwizard with tests
  written in selenium, junit and mockito.

  work with the latest browsers (ie10, firefox, chrome).  Converted
  legacy prototype code to jquery; test driven with jasmine.

  (Nov 2011-March 2012)

  _Team Lead Developer with Cyrus_

  Led a team of developers working on an app that allows public access
  channels to collect, schedule and distribute video content through a
  simple web interface. Content creators could log in and upload their
  videos for channel admins to approve and schedule. Behind the scenes
  the app would validate and transcode the content into an appropriate
  format and then stream it directly to the local cable tv providers.

* **Cyrus Skunkworks**

  _ Software Product Researcher and Developer_

  (March-Dec 2007, April 2009-April 2011)

  _Software Developer and Coach with Cyrus_

  On the Boston Capital team I worked on a sophisticated asset
  management web app. This application allows for complex data entry
  with validation, document management, asset performance reporting,
  and tax credit calculations. It is developed in java and groovy
  using webwork, picocontainer, hibernate and sql server with tests
  written in selenium, junit, jbehave, mockito and spock. I helped
  build this on-site XP development team from the ground up.

* **Lehman Brothers**

  Spent this single day moving code from rcs to svn. The project was
  abruptly cancelled as their position in the housing market began to
