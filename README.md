At Cyrus I have written software for clients using Extreme
Programming practices and a range of technologies. I've coached
new team members at all experience levels helping them get up to
speed extremely quickly. I regularly facilitate retrospective
meetings using a toolkit of analytic techniques to remove
obstacles and solve problems.

rails, mysql, sidekiq and fog.io with tests written in rspec and
mocha.

Bazaarvoice

TelVue
Team Lead Developer with Cyrus
Nov 2011-March 2012

Led a team of developers working on an app that allows public access
channels to collect, schedule and distribute video content through a
simple web interface. Content creators could log in and upload their
videos for channel admins to approve and schedule. Behind the scenes
the app would validate and transcode the content into an appropriate
format and then stream it directly to the local cable tv providers.

with validation, document management, asset performance reporting,
and tax credit calculations. It is developed in java and groovy
using webwork, picocontainer, hibernate and sql server with tests
written in selenium, junit, jbehave, mockito and spock. I helped
build this on-site XP development team from the ground up.
