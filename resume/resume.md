Experience
----------

Cyrus Innovation
Senior Agile Developer and Developer Coach
March 2007-Present

At Cyrus I've developed software using a range of practices,
technologies and design techniques. I've coached new team members at
all experience levels helping them get up to speed extremely quickly.
I regularly facilitate retrospective meetings using a range of
analytic techniques to remove obstacles and solve problems.

One the New York Times Infrastructure team I am developing an intranet
web app that provides an intuitive 'Application' abstraction for
organizing raw cloud computing resources. It manages cloud resources
from AWS as well as from internal VMWare clusters. The app uses rails,
mysql, sidekiq and fog.io with tests written in rspec.

On the Bazaarvoice team I worked on a business to business sales
portal that helped brand representatives purchase and configure BV
products. The app is a Java based web app using spring mvc, gwt and
dropwizard with tests written in selenium, junit and mockito.

On the Telvue team I led a team of developers working on a rails app.
The app provides a way for public access channels to collect, schedule
and distribute content submissions through a simple web interface.
Content creators could log in and upload their videos for channel
admins to approve and schedule. Behind the scenes the app would
validate and transcode the content into an appropriate format and then
stream it directly to the local cable tv providers.

On the Boston Capital team I worked on an asset management web app.
This is a large application responsible for complicated data entry
with validation, document management, performance metric reporting,
and tax calculations. It is developed in java and groovy using
webwork, picocontainer, hibernate and sql server with tests written in
selenium, junit, jbehave, mockito and spock. I collaborated on
building this on-site XP development team from the ground up.

On the Kaplan team I (1) Developed software using Java,
Spring/MVC/AOP, Hibernate and EJB2. (2) Coached an existing
development team toward Extreme Programming.

Boston Dynamics
Junior Programmer
Summer 2006

On the DI-Guy product team I (1) Implemented user interface elements
in C++ using the Qt UI framework. (2) Fixed software bugs in response
to end user and internal bug reports. (3) Added i18n support to the
DI-Guy application in order to create a Japanese version of the
product.

Cryptography Group at Columbia U
Student Researcher
January 2005-August 2005

Assisted with cryptography research by writing a test implementation
of an intrusion resilient signature scheme. Studied the IPSec
cryptographic standard.

Postcrypt Art Gallery

promotion, art curation and art show design for about 10 gallery
openings per year.
